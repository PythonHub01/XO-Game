X-O Game for Two Players

Game Concept:

The game is played on a 3×3 board.
Each player picks an empty spot and places their symbol.
The first player to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all spaces are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.

Key main Functions in the Code:

create_board() → Initializes an empty board.
print_board() → Displays the current board for players.
get_player_info() → Gets each player's name and symbol.
get_move() → Takes the player's move and validates it.
check_winner() → Checks if there is a winner.
is_draw() → Determines if the board is full with no winner.
play_game() → Manages the entire game from start to finish.

How to Play:

When the game starts, each player selects their name and symbol.
Each turn, the game displays the board and asks the current player to choose a number (1-9) to place their symbol.
The game continues until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
