# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (XO)

## Project Overview
This is a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game (XO) developed by a team of programmers. The game allows two players to compete on a 3x3 board, taking turns to place their marks. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spots are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
